      <p>You are Thor, the god of Thunder. You stand in the golden halls of Asgard, Mjolnir resting at
         your side.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, Heimdall calls out: dark forces have been detected on earth. Loki may be involved.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Odin has summoned you to remain in Asgard and prepare for a possible war in Jotunheim.
      </p>
      <p>What do you do? Travel to Earth to protect it, or remain in Asgard?</p>
   </div>

   <div class="storyPart" id="answer02">
      <p>Answer Yes when you're ready!</p>
   </div>

   <div class="storyPart" id="err0">
      <p>Please answer yes or no.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="storyPart" id="answer11">
      <p>You choose to travel to Earth. With a mighty spin of Mjolnir, lightning surrounds you as you soar through the
         Bifrost.</p>
      <p>You land in New York City just as chaos erupts — creatures from another realm are attacking.</p>
      <p>As you fight them off, you hear a familiar voice.</p>
      <p>"Brother."</p>
      <p>Loki steps from the shadows, smiling as always. He claims this invasion is only the beginning.</p>
      <p>You must decide: confront Loki immediately, or help the people of Earth escape to safety first.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
      <p>You remain in Asgard, honoring Odin’s command.</p>
      <p>Without your presence, Earth’s defenders struggle — but Asgard is saved from a surprise attack.</p>
      <p>Odin nods in approval, though you cannot shake the feeling that Earth needed you.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
      <p>Please answer Earth or Asgard.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
      <p>You confront Loki at once. Thunder crashes as you battle across the city.</p>
      <p>In the end, Loki is defeated and captured. The invasion collapses without its leader.</p>
      <p>The people of Earth cheer as you stand victorious, lightning fading around you.</p>
      <p>You smile, knowing you have once again proven yourself worthy.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
      <p>You choose to save the people first, guiding civilians to safety.</p>
      <p>When you return, Loki has escaped.</p>
      <p>Though Earth is safe for now, you know your brother will return — and next time, the battle will be even
         greater.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="storyPart" id="err2">
      <p>Please answer Fight or Save.</p>
